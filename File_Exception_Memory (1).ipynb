        "   * When the count becomes zero, the object is immediately deleted.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Garbage Collector (GC):**\n",

        "   * Periodically scans and frees memory that can't be reached.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Generational GC:**\n",
        "   * Python divides objects into **3 generations** (0, 1, 2) based on age.\n",
        "   * Young objects are collected more frequently; older ones less often (for efficiency).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Memory Pools (pymalloc):**\n",
        "   * Manages small memory blocks internally to reduce fragmentation and improve performance.\n",

        "🔹 **Manual Garbage Collection:**\n",
